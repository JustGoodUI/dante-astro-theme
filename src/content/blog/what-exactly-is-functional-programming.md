### what exactly is functional programming ?

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. What it means is that , instead of binding state and associated methods on the data members together , in functional programming, we define functions and pass data and compose them together.

First-Class and Higher-Order Functions: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. Higher-order functions are those that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

Pure Functions: Functions always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects (do not alter any state or data outside the function).

Immutability: Data is immutable, meaning once it is created, it cannot be changed. This leads to simpler and more predictable code.

Function Composition: Functions can be composed to build more complex functions from simpler ones.

Declarative Style: Code focuses on what to do rather than how to do it, making use of expressions rather than statements.
