Hi there! I am glad you're 😊

My friends describe me as someone who embrace the versatility and mutability of life. Also a bit rebellious, I am a freedom seeker above all. I am not settling for the status quo, and often look for deeper meaning and connections in life.

# Life Highlights 
🌴 Born and raised in the South of France

🦉 Educational background in international law with a specialisation in peace building through justice and conflict resolution studies in post-conflict countries. 

⚡️ I worked as a diplomat and legal attaché at the United Nations where I represented France in diplomatic duties, to then become a software developer in search for more creativity and independence. 

🌎 I reinvented myself across 7 countries - Brazil, Peru, US, Canada, Netherlands, UK, Italy - finding new passions and connections along the way. 

🏔️ I am an explorer and environmental advocate with a penchant for high altitude hikes. Adventures such as hiking through the highest peaks of the Pyrenees for 20 days led to positive and long-lasting change!
