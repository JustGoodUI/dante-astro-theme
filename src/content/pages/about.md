# Sagnik Chatterjee

ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹, hi beautiful people of the Internet. I'm Sagnik and a software developer by profession; I'm also a self-confessed fan of mathematical logic, proof-oriented, and functional programming.

## Skills and Expertise

I am very skilled in building **fullstack** software using the following stack:

- React(Nextjs)
- Typescript
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
- tRPC
- Node/Bun

Additionally I have been exploring other programming languages, during nights and weekends:

- Go -> to learn more about concurrency and going multi-threaded
- OCaml -> to learn about concrete type systems and what lies beyond gradual typing in Typescript
- Coq -> exploring how can we write secure systems with formal verification and deductive reasoning.

Apart from work, I also talk tech with folks in the [Reason/OCaml India Group](https://discord.gg/4UvnqV3h) and the [Effect.ts Group](https://discord.com/invite/effect-ts). Feel free to say hi to me in you join up : sagnikcw#5614.
