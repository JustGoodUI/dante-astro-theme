#### We often need open, brave and safe space in order to fully let ourselves "be", so we can shift perspective on who we are, where we want to be, and how to get there. Coaching help you uncover that. I'd love to meet you and chat!

- Want to make a positive impact in the world
- Want to turn challenges and uncertainties into opportunities for growth
- Are navigating change, and feel overwhelmed about the discomfort and uncertainties
- Are handling tough conversations at work or at home (feedback, firing, conflicts...)
- Lack confidence and energy to move forward
- Want to transition career or move to a different industry but don't know where to start 
- Are leading teams but struggle to find ways to communicate effectively
- Want to find the role that makes you feel most vibrant and fulfilled.

## With me, you can:
- Develop a personal transition plan

- Be confident, excited and clear on what you want!
- Deal with conflict better 
- Set Up regular check-ins for boost
