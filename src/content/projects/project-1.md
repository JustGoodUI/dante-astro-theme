**Project Overview:**

## Raising Awareness 
Did you know the Netherlands has more light pollution than China and the United States? 
Did you know that flowers production has a massive environmental impact on animals and humans health?

## Photography 
[Photos](https://bossenbroek.photo/7-rad) are taken by Photograph Anton Bossenbroek. I've been his assistant on the field for this project since 2019.

## Adventure
For this project, Anton and I lived in a camper for 2 months in order to be as mobile as possible in the Netherlands. 

## Tech
I build Anton Photography website using Nextjs, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Neon for the database, google clouds for storing images, and cloudflare pages for hosting and deploying. You can check it [here](https://bossenbroek.photo)
